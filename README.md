# Treasure Disks for CC: Tweaked

Previous versions of ComputerCraft (1.79 and below) added treasure disks, which
generated in dungeon chests. However, in later versions, these disks are
considered deprecated.

This data pack restores this functionality, and may be used as a template to
register your own loot disks.

## Usage
 - This pack requires Minecraft 1.21 and the latest version of CC: Tweaked
 - [Download this repository](https://github.com/SquidDev-CC/treasure-disks/archive/master.zip)
 - Save it to the `datapacks` folder of your current Minecraft save.

## Reporting bugs
These programs haven't been tested and updated for a long time (since 2016), and
so may have broken in later versions of ComputerCraft. If you do have problems,
please report a bug!
